          answer: 'Absolutely! Sandspiel is completely free and open-source. You can play online at sandspiel.club without downloads, registration, or payment. The source code is available on GitHub for developers.'
        },
        {
          question: 'What makes Sandspiel different from other sandbox games?',
          answer: 'Sandspiel focuses on realistic pixel physics with detailed element interactions. Unlike simple drawing tools, every particle follows physical laws. It\'s inspired by classic falling-sand games but built with modern web technology for smooth performance.'
        },
        {
          question: 'Can I play Sandspiel on mobile devices?',
          answer: 'Sandspiel works best on desktop browsers with mouse control for precise element placement. While it may run on mobile browsers, the experience is optimized for mouse interaction and larger screens.'
        },
        {
          question: 'How do I create complex structures in Sandspiel?',
          answer: 'Start with Stone for foundations since it forms arches and is pressure-resistant. Use Wall for permanent barriers, Sand for terrain, and Water for rivers. Combine Wood and Plant for organic growth, and experiment with element layering.'
        },
        {
          question: 'What happens when I mix different elements?',
          answer: 'Elements interact in realistic ways: Water puts out Fire, Ice freezes Water, Gas explodes near Fire, Acid corrodes most materials, Plants grow in wet conditions, Fungus spreads over surfaces, and Mites consume organic materials. Experimentation is key!'
        },
        {
          question: 'Is there an expanded version of Sandspiel?',
          answer: 'Yes! Sandspiel Studio offers infinite new elements and enhanced creation tools. The original Sandspiel at sandspiel.club remains free with the core experience, while Studio provides advanced features for serious creators.'
        },
        {
          question: 'How does the physics simulation work technically?',
          answer: 'Sandspiel uses cellular automata with custom physics written in Rust, compiled to WebAssembly for performance. WebGL handles rendering for smooth 120+ FPS. This combination provides real-time physics simulation with thousands of interacting particles.'
